# Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `assignment.ipynb`, which performs basic data analysis and visualization on a selected CSV dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib/seaborn.

##  Project Tasks

###  Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded a CSV dataset using **pandas**
- Displayed the first few rows using `.head()`
- Inspected data types and missing values
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing data appropriately

###  Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Computed basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) using `.describe()`
- Grouped data by a categorical column and calculated aggregated means
- Identified patterns and insights from the data

### Task 3: Data Visualization
Created four types of visualizations:
1. **Line Chart** â€“ to show trends over time
2. **Bar Chart** â€“ to compare numerical values across categories
3. **Histogram** â€“ to understand the distribution of a numeric column
4. **Scatter Plot** â€“ to visualize relationships between two numerical variables
